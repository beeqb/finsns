This is the research project leading by Dr. Ren Fei (East China University of Science and Technology, ECUST) and collaborating with Dr. Yue Wu (East China University of Science and Technology). It contains a set of Python programs to collect data from SNS (e.g. Sina Weibo), analysis of the SNS data and utilise the results to predict the risk of financial market.
